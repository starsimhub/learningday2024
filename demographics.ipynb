    "## How does Starsim handle demographics?\n",
    "If you create a simulation in Starsim, demographics are not included by default. This is because there are lots of applications that don't require it, for instance if you're simulating an outbreak or a short timespan like one season. However, if you're simulating over time horizons longer than a year or two, it might become increasingly important to add information about the demographics changes over time. And even over short time horizons, many diseases disproportionately affect younger or older populations, so you may still like to add some information about the population age structure."
