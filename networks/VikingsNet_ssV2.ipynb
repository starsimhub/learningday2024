    "### Class: `VikingsNet`\n",
    "This class is designed to model a dynamic network where vikings are the agents, and their interactions are captured as connections. The network evolves over time, with pairs of vikings being connected for specific durations. It inherits from `ss.DynamicNetwork`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__(self, key_dict=None, preBoard=True, postBoard=False, **kwargs)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** This is the constructor method that initializes the `VikingsNet` object.\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `key_dict`: A dictionary that defines network edge attributes, such as the duration (`dur`), start time (`start`), and end time (`end`) for interactions between vikings.\n",
    "  - `preBoard`: A flag that indicates if certain network setup tasks should be done before the simulation starts.\n",
    "  - `postBoard`: A flag for tasks to perform after the simulation ends.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** \n",
    "  - It calls `sc.mergedicts()` to merge any custom keys provided in `key_dict` with the default ones: `dur`, `start`, and `end`.\n",
    "  - It initializes the network by calling the superclass constructor (this is, the DynamicsNetwork base class), passing in the `key_dict`, `preBoard`, and `postBoard` flags along with any additional arguments (`kwargs`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `init_pre(self, sim)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Prepares the network for the simulation.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** \n",
    "  - Calls `super().init_pre(sim)`, which initializes the network structure before the simulation begins. This is important for setting up the network at time step 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `add_pairs(self, viking_inds=None, second_viking_inds=None, dur=None, start=None)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Adds pairs of vikings to the network, representing connections between them.\n",
    "- **Parameters:**\n",
    "  - `viking_inds`: The first set of vikings involved in interactions.\n",
    "  - `second_viking_inds`: The second set of vikings involved in interactions.\n",
    "  - `dur`: The duration for which each pair remains connected.\n",
    "  - `start`: The time step at which each interaction starts. If not provided, it defaults to the current simulation time (`self.sim.ti`).\n",
    "- **Functionality:** \n",
    "  - If no vikings are provided (`viking_inds is None`), the method returns 0 (no connections are made).\n",
    "  - For each pair of vikings, it sets `beta` to 1, indicating active transmission of interaction between them, and calculates the `end` time for the interaction as `start + 2`.\n",
    "  - Finally, it appends the connection to the network with details about the participating vikings (`p1`, `p2`), the interaction strength (`beta`), duration (`dur`), and timing (`start`, `end`).\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### `update(self)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Updates the network by modifying connection properties as the simulation progresses.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** \n",
    "  - The method sets `beta` (the interaction strength) to 0 for any connections where the interaction duration has been completed (i.e., when `end` time is less than or equal to the current simulation time).\n",
    "  - This simulates the end of interaction or disease transmission between vikings in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `end_pairs(self)`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Cleans up network edges by removing inactive connections.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** \n",
    "  - The method identifies \"active\" connections as those where:\n",
    "    - The interaction hasn't ended yet (`self.edges.end > self.sim.ti`), and\n",
    "    - Both vikings involved in the interaction are still alive (`people.alive[self.edges.p1] & people.alive[self.edges.p2]`).\n",
    "  - It removes any inactive edges by updating the internal data structures that track edges.\n",
    "  - It returns the number of active connections remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall Explanation:\n",
    "The `VikingsNet` class represents a network of interactions between vikings, dynamically evolving throughout the simulation. Pairs of vikings are connected for a specified duration, during which interactions occur (e.g., representing the spread of disease). As the simulation progresses, connections are updated or removed based on their duration and the status of the individuals involved. This class is highly flexible, allowing dynamic pairings, variable durations, and time-based updates to the network.\n"

    "# Defining the simulation\n",
    "### Overall Summary:\n",
    "This code block sets up and initializes a simulation with the following key elements:\n",
    "- **Disease dynamics** using an `SIR` model with a 10% initial disease prevalence and a transmission rate (`beta`) of 0.01.\n",
    "- **Demographic processes** with a population of 500 agents, where new births occur every 0.25 years.\n",
    "- The simulation starts on January 1st, 2000, and runs for 2 years, updating every 2 days.\n",
    "- Although the network model is not explicitly defined here (a random network is commented out), it implies the use of a custom network like `VikingsNet`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `pars = dict(...)`\n",
    "This block defines a dictionary named `pars`, which contains various parameters for the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`diseases`:**\n",
    "  - This parameter specifies the type of disease model being used. In this case, it's an `SIR` model (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered).\n",
    "  - `ss.SIR(unit='day', dt=1.0, init_prev=0.1, beta=ss.beta(0.01))`: \n",
    "    - **`unit='day'`**: The time unit for disease transmission is in days.\n",
    "    - **`dt=1.0`**: The time step for disease progression is 1 day.\n",
    "    - **`init_prev=0.1`**: The initial prevalence of the disease in the population is 10% (0.1).\n",
    "    - **`beta=ss.beta(0.01)`**: This defines the disease transmission rate (or infectivity) as 0.01. The `ss.beta()` function is used to calculate this value, which indicates how likely a disease is transmitted between agents per contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`demographics`:**\n",
    "  - This parameter defines the demographic processes happening in the simulation.\n",
    "  - `ss.Births(unit='year', dt=0.25)`: \n",
    "    - **`unit='year'`**: The time unit for demographic events like births is in years.\n",
    "    - **`dt=0.25`**: The time step for demographic events is 0.25 years (3 months). This parameter ensures the population can grow through births at this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`n_agents = 500`:**\n",
    "  - Agents to be simulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `sim = ss.Sim(pars, unit='day', dt=2, start='2000-01-01', stop='2002-01-01')`\n",

    "- **Arguments:**\n",
    "  - **`pars`**: The dictionary of parameters defined earlier, which includes the disease model, demographics, start time, and agent count.\n",
    "  - **`unit='day'`**: This sets the time unit for the entire simulation as days. It means that each step in the simulation corresponds to one day.\n",
    "  - **`dt=2`**: This sets the time step to 2 days, meaning the simulation updates every 2 days (rather than every single day).\n",
    "  - **`start='2000-01-01'`**: This sets the exact start date for the simulation: \n",
    "  - **`stop='2002-01-01'`**: This sets the stop date for the simulation: The simulation will run for 2 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `sim.init()`\n",
    "- **Purpose:** \n",
    "  - This initializes the simulation before it runs. It prepares the simulation environment, such as setting up the agents, initial conditions (like disease prevalence), and demographic parameters.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Functionality:**\n",
    "  - The `init()` function is responsible for loading and setting up the simulation according to the parameters provided. It ensures that everything is ready to run the simulation from the start date.\n",
