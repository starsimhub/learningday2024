# IDM Symposium 

## starsim Networks

### **Objective:**
Introduce participants to Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) using the Networks module in starsim, emphasizing theoretical concepts, practical applications, and how to utilize the module for effective network-based simulations.

### **Target Audience:**
Intermediate users of starsim or individuals with a basic understanding of modeling and  who are interested in Agent-Based Modeling.

### **Materials Needed:**
- Presentation slides detailing key concepts and demonstrations
- notebook showcasing the network module

### **Preparation Steps:**
- Develop and test presentation slides and case study content
- Prepare a demonstration scenario for ABM with starsim
- Gather additional resources for post-session exploration

### **Follow-Up:**
- Share a summary of key points and additional resources with participants
- Distribute a recording of the session (if applicable) or links to further materials - Not sure if this will be recorded and if we can actually share it. 
- Collect feedback to assess the training's effectiveness and areas for improvement
