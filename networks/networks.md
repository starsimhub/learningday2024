# IDM Symposium 

## starsim Networks

### **Objective:**
Introduce participants to Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) using the Networks module in starsim, emphasizing theoretical concepts, practical applications, and how to utilize the module for effective network-based simulations.

### **Target Audience:**
Intermediate users of starsim or individuals with a basic understanding of modeling and network analysis who are interested in Agent-Based Modeling.

### **Agenda:**

1. **Introduction (5 minutes)**
   - Welcome and objectives of the session
   - Overview of starsim and the Networks module
   - Importance and applications of Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) in network analysis

2. **Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling (10 minutes)**
   - Core concepts of ABM: agents, environment, and interactions
   - How ABM differs from other modeling approaches
   - Applications and benefits of ABM in network analysis

3. **Overview of the Networks Module in starsim (10 minutes)**
   - Key features and functionalities specific to ABM
   - Typical use cases and how the module supports ABM
   - Example scenarios illustrating the use of ABM in network analysis

4. **Demonstration of ABM with starsim (20 minutes)**
   - Setting up an Agent-Based Model using the Networks module
     - Defining agents and their behaviors
     - Configuring network parameters and interactions
   - Running simulations and analyzing outcomes
     - Interpreting results and understanding agent dynamics
     - Visualization tools and metrics available in starsim

5. **Case Study Presentation (10 minutes)**
   - Presentation of a real-world case study using ABM in network analysis
   - Overview of the problem, the ABM approach with starsim, and the outcomes
   - Discussion of insights gained and practical implications

6. **Q&A and Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**
   - Open floor for questions and discussion
   - Recap of key points and takeaways
   - Provide additional resources and recommendations for further learning

### **Materials Needed:**
- Presentation slides detailing key concepts and demonstrations
- Example dataset and case study information
- Access to starsim for live demonstration

### **Preparation Steps:**
- Develop and test presentation slides and case study content
- Prepare a demonstration scenario for ABM with starsim
- Ensure availability of starsim for live demo
- Gather additional resources for post-session exploration

### **Follow-Up:**
- Share a summary of key points and additional resources with participants
- Distribute a recording of the session (if applicable) or links to further materials - Not sure if this will be recorded and if we can actually share it. 
- Collect feedback to assess the training's effectiveness and areas for improvement
