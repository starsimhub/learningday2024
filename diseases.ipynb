One option is to just adjust all you parameters accordingly, e.g. if you're modeling a disease with an infectious period of 2 weeks, you could enter `dur_inf=14/365`. However, Starsim also offers more support for using different units.\n",

    "In the example below, we use a few new tricks. Firstly, when we create the disease module, we use `ss.beta` and `ss.dur`, two methods that help Starsim understand that we want it to be smart about handling the timesteps. Using `ss.dur()` allows you to say that the duration is in units of days, weeks, months, or years.  Then secondly, when we create the simulation, we provide a lot more information about time, including that we want to start on day 0 and run the simulation for 30 days."
